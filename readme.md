## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year computer science student at UNSW Sydney. My commits are generally just me archiving personal work.

Lately I've been boggled by uni work, but have some ongoing projects:
 - An [expense tracker](https://expense.mhiebl.com) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/expense-app)
 - A simple [todo app](https://todo.mhiebl.com) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/todo-app)
 - Some [visualisations](https://matthiebl.github.io/visuals/) - and rendering [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/visuals)
 - A [calculator](https://mhiebl-facidle.web.app/) for an idle game I've been playing [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/factory-idle-calculator)
 - An online [timer for workouts](https://fitness.mhiebl.com/timer) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/fitness-app)
