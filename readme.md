## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've just finished my third (and last) year of computer science at UNSW Sydney.
My commits are generally just me archiving personal work.

Check out my new [about me website](https://mhiebl.com)!

At the moment I've been taking a break after finishing uni, but have some ongoing projects:
 - A multiplayer app for [playing games](https://games.mhiebl.com) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/games-app)
 - An [expense tracker](https://expense.mhiebl.com) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/expense-app)
   - I'm currently updating this with TailwindUI, more to show soon!
 - A simple [todo app](https://todo.mhiebl.com) - [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/todo-app)
 - Some [visualisations](https://matthiebl.github.io/visuals/) - and rendering [[Code]](https://github.com/matthiebl/visuals)

I like tailwindcss... like a lot

I like Typescript, but I love strongly typed languages even more (ah Haskell...)

And of course I like making React apps! NextJS perchance?
